Please ensure that your answer is well-grounded in the context and directly addresses the question.

Answer it shortly. I don't need any explanations, just the direct answer. 
For example, if your answer woule be: "No, the provided context does not support this statement. The documents do not mention 'The Age' or 'TechCrunch', and the information attributed to 'The Verge' suggests Google's deals were seen as effective for gaining market share, not unnecessary."
Just output "No". Do not output later explanation!

    "The case, filed by Arkansas-based publisher Helena World Chronicle, argues that Google “siphons off” news publishers’ content, their readers and ad revenue through anticompetitive means."

question: “Does 'The Verge' article suggest that Google's deals with companies like Apple are unnecessary due to a plethora of alternatives, while 'The Age' and 'TechCrunch' articles imply Google's actions are primarily driven by profit maximization and anticompetitive behavior, respectively?”

answer: “no”

Demonstration 2:

PAIRWISE_RERANK_PROMPT = """You are a careful QA reranker. Score how useful the passage is for answering the user’s query.

Output strictly as compact JSON on one line: {{"score": <0-100 integer>, "justification": "<≤200 chars>"}}

Scoring rubric (0–100):
- 90–100: Directly answers the query (facts, entities, numbers, or steps are present). High coverage, low ambiguity.
- 70–89: Strongly relevant; contains key evidence but may miss a detail or require synthesis.
- 40–69: Tangential or partial; mentions some entities/terms but insufficient to answer fully.
- 1–39: Mostly off-topic, meta, or background noise.
- 0: Contradictory or unrelated.

Rules:
- Base judgment ONLY on the passage text. Do not use outside knowledge.
- Reward faithful evidence (entities, numbers, definitions, steps).
- Penalize contradictions, vague mentions, or generic boilerplate.
- If the question asks for a definition, formula, or specific fact, require it to appear in the passage.
